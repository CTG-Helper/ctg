  "BASELINE_INFO": "The NICHD nomenclature defines baseline fetal heart rate as: The baseline FHR is determined by approximating the mean FHR rounded to increments of 5 beats per minute (bpm) during a 10-minute window, excluding accelerations and decelerations and periods of marked FHR variability (greater than 25 bpm). There must be at least 2 minutes of identifiable baseline segments (not necessarily contiguous) in any 10-minute window, or the baseline for that period is indeterminate. In such cases, it may be necessary to refer to the previous 10-minute window for determination of the baseline. Abnormal baseline is termed bradycardia when the baseline FHR is less than 110 bpm; it is termed tachycardia when the baseline FHR is greater than 160 bpm.",
  "DECELERATION_FREQUENCY_INFO": "Periodic refers to decelerations that are associated with contractions; episodic refers to those not associated with contractions. There are four types of decelerations as defined by the NICHD nomenclature, all of which are visually assessed",
  "DECELERATION_FORM_INFO": "Periodic refers to decelerations that are associated with contractions; episodic refers to those not associated with contractions. There are four types of decelerations as defined by the NICHD nomenclature, all of which are visually assessed",
  "VARIABILITY_INFO": "Moderate baseline fetal heart rate variability reflects the delivery of oxygen to the fetal central nervous system. Its presence is reassuring in predicting an absence of metabolic acidemia and hypoxic injury to the fetus at the time it is observed.[9] In contrast, the presence of mild baseline FHR variability, or an absence of FHR variability does not reliably predict fetal acidemia or hypoxia; lack of moderate baseline FHR variability may be a result of the fetal sleep cycle, or a result of medications, extreme prematurity, congenital anomalies, or pre-existing neurological injury.[9]",
  "ACCELERATION_INFO": "The NICHD nomenclature[9] defines an acceleration as a visually apparent abrupt increase in fetal heart rate. An abrupt increase is defined as an increase from the onset of acceleration to the peak in less than or equal to 30 seconds. To be called an acceleration, the peak must be greater than or equal to 15 bpm, and the acceleration must last greater than or equal to 15 seconds from the onset to return to baseline.[12] A prolonged acceleration is greater than or equal to 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes in duration. An acceleration lasting greater than or equal to 10 minutes is defined as a baseline change. Before 32 weeks of gestation, accelerations are defined as having a peak greater than or equal to 10 bpm and a duration of greater than or equal to 10 seconds.",

  "VARIABILITY_SEGMENT_INFO_3":"Less than 2 BPM for less than 10 min, normal baby can be asleep",
  "VARIABILITY_SEGMENT_INFO_4":"2-5 BPM. Reduced variability is amplitude<5 bpm for > 40-60 min in baseline segments, or for > 3 min during decelerations. ",
  "VARIABILITY_SEGMENT_INFO_5":"5-25 BPM, Beat-to-beat or short-term variability is the oscillation of the FHR around the baseline in amplitude of 5 to 10 bpm. Long-term variability is a somewhat slower oscillation in heart rate and has a frequency of three to 10 cycles per minute and an amplitude of 10 to 25 bpm. ",
  "VARIABILITY_SEGMENT_INFO_6":"More than 25 BPM, sign of saltatory pattern",
  "VARIABILITY_SEGMENT_INFO_7":"Sinusoidal pattern is a regular, smooth, undulating pattern resembling a sinus wave, with amplitude 5-15 bpm at frequency 3-5 cycles/min, lasting for >30 min and coinciding with absent accelerations",

  "DECELERATION_FORM_SEGMENT_INFO_1":"Variable  decelerations Mild/non-complicated, classified according to their depth and duration , when the depth is above 80 bpm or the amplitude is less than 60 bpm and the duration is less than 30 seconds ",
  "DECELERATION_FORM_SEGMENT_INFO_2":"Variable decelerations  Moderate severe/complicated if repetitivathe duration is longer than 60 seconds, pathological",
  "DECELERATION_FORM_SEGMENT_INFO_3":"Consistently Early decelerations are caused by fetal head compression during uterine contraction, resulting in vagal stimulation and slowing of the heart rate ",
  "DECELERATION_FORM_SEGMENT_INFO_4":"Consistently Late decelerations start more than 20 seconds after the onset of a contraction and take more than 30 seconds to recover to baseline values .Late decelerations are associated with uteroplacental insufficiency and are provoked by uterine contractions.",
  "DECELERATION_FORM_SEGMENT_INFO_5":"Prolonged, severe prolonged bradycardia of less than 80 bpm that lasts for three minutes or longer is an ominous finding indicating severe hypoxia.",
